title: Code in footnote
format: html
---

**Actually, this is fine, the problem was in my custom `.scss`** 

In Quarto v1.4, footnote text is smaller, but code is relatively too big.[^1]

In this playground...[^2]

Here's some `code` in the text.

[^1]: In this footnote `this bit of monospace` is way bigger than the text.

[^2]: Here's a code chunk:

	```{r}
	library(palmerpenguins)
	head(penguins)
	```
